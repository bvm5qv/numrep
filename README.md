# The up calculation of the bessel functions is more accurate. While the up and down calculations were often very similar, the larger the order of the function and the smaller the value of x, the larger the two computations differed from each other (the "up" calculation being the more accurate of the two when compared to known values of the functions as found in Landau table 2.1).


# The slopes of the graphs do seem to agree with the model's predictions. The behavior of each of the derivative methods are globally similar, though change their feature different local behavior at various values of h. Roughly, it seems that algorithmic error dominates for h > 1E-3 whereas round off error dominates for h < 1E-7.
